## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[No external sources used]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I had a challenge with the making the sound audible on buttons. I couln't hear the sound even though I increased the volume. I had to look up the mosueup and mousedown pats to ensure that the code was correct. As I assumed the code was not in correct sequece; and once I figured that my problem was easily fixed.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Is it safe to use a website without web anticrawler? Is it possible to do web development with only object-oriented programming languages such as Python? How long should a project be?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would do the optional part; thus adding more than 4 functional game buttonsPlayback speeds up on each turn, computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played, player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake), game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image) and game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)]
